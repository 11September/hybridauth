Get Involved
============

HybridAuth is a community driven project, and it needs your help to keep the project going.


### Report Problems

A great way to help is to find and submit [bug reports](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/issues) or to fix the existing ones. 

When reporting new issues, please provide as much detail and context as possible, otherwise we will be left in the dark about the problem you having.

For general questions (i.e, "how-to" questions), please consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hybridauth) instead of the Github issues tracker. For convenience, we also have a [low-activity] mailing list at [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/hybridauth) and a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/hybridauth/hybridauth) if you want to get help directly from the community.


### Documentation

You can help improve Hybridauth user documentation (this website) by making it more consistent and readable, and by adding missing information, correcting errors and typos.

Hybridauth documentation is maintained as plain text markdown files at https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/tree/master/docs/


### Develop

If you have fixed a bug or implemented a new feature that you would like to share with the community, send a pull request against the [dev branch](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/).

Before contributing code, please consider these Guide Lines:

**PHP Style**

HybridAuth follows [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

**Compatibility**

Additional providers, minor enhancements, bugs and typos fixes are most welcome. Large and "breaking" changes should be discussed ahead of time. **Please ask first**.

HybridAuth 3 is compatible with **PHP 5.4** and therefore all code supplied must stick to this requirement.
