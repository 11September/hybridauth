# Contributing to HybridAuth

HybridAuth is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form of Issues or [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on the [HybridAuth repository](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/) on GitHub.

Issues are a quick way to point out a bug, not to ask general question (for that there is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hybridauth)). If you find a bug in HybridAuth then please check a few things first:

1. There is not already an open Issue.
2. The issue has already been fixed (check the master branch, or look for closed Issues).
3. That you have everything setup properly with your providers.
4. Is it something really obvious that you can fix yourself?

## Guidelines

Before we look into how, here are the guidelines. If your Pull Requests fail to pass these guidelines it will be declined and you will need to re-submit when you've made the changes. This might sound a bit tough, but it is required for us to maintain quality of the code-base.

### PHP Style

* Readable code come first.
* Clear indentation come second. Please use tabs (not 4 spaces and definitely not 2 spaces).
* For the rest simply try to follow the existing style.

### Compatibility

HybridAuth 3 is compatible with PHP 5.4 so all code supplied must stick to this requirement.

Additional providers, minor enhancements, bugs and typos fixes are most welcome.

Large and "breaking" changes should be discussed ahead of time. Please ask first.

### Documentation

If you change anything that requires a change to documentation then you will need to add it. New providers, methods, parameters, changing default values, etc are all things that will require a change to documentation.

The CHANGELOG.md should also be updated when sending a Pull-Request.

## License

Hybridauth PHP Library is released under the terms of MIT License.

This following part should be obvious to anyone familiar with open source development processes, but we'll mention it anyway:

1. By contributing your code to the project, you agree to license your contribution under the MIT License (Once you Donate your code to the community, it become freely available to everyone to use, or misuse).

2. All Hybridauth files are copyrighted to the Hybridauth authors (Inserting personal names inside the code is not cool any more).
